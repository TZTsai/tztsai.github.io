<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The global energy consumption of mobile networks is rapidly increasing due to the exponential<br>
growth of mobile network traffic. The advent of next-generation cellular technologies such<br>
as fifth-generation (5G) and beyond promises higher network throughput and lower latency<br>
but also demands higher power consumption for its denser base station (BS) deployment and<br>
more energy-intensive processors. It is one of the key design pillars of next-generation mobile<br>
networks to improve network energy efficiency. In this thesis, we aim to address this problem<br>
by applying machine learning to analyze mobile traffic and control the operation of 5G BSs<br>
with the goal of reducing network energy consumption while dynamically meeting the network<br>
traffic demand. To obtain some preliminary insights into the temporal and spatial patterns<br>
of mobile network traffic, we first analyze a real-world network flow dataset collected by a<br>
Swedish mobile operator. We find that mobile traffic exhibits a strong periodicity in time and<br>
a distinct locality in space. In order to develop a simulation environment to train and evaluate<br>
the artificial intelligence (AI)-based BS control algorithm, we apply a clustering algorithm to<br>
categorize the network traffic with different latency requirements into five traffic scenarios, e.g.<br>
urban, rural, and office. Other necessary network models are also implemented such as energy<br>
consumption, massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) channel, user association, etc.<br>
in the simulation environment endeavoring to mimic the real-world 5G network.</p>
<p>The main contribution of this thesis is the development of a multi-agent reinforcement learning<br>
algorithm to jointly control the operations of 5G BSs such as multi-level sleeping, antenna<br>
switching, and user association. The algorithm is designed to minimize the total energy<br>
consumption of a multi-cell 5G network while preserving its overall quality of service (QoS).<br>
The trained algorithm has shown its ability to adaptively save energy by switching on/off the<br>
sleep modes and antennas of BSs according to the varying traffic intensity. Moreover, the<br>
multi-agent BS control policy produced by the algorithm has also demonstrated collaborative<br>
behaviours such as user offloading that reduces inter-cell interference which degrades the QoS.<br>
The evaluation results show that in comparison to the always-on configuration, the proposed<br>
algorithm can reduce the total energy consumption of a network by about 50%, double that of<br>
today’s symbol-level sleeping strategy (25%), while with negligible degradation of QoS. The<br>
algorithm is also shown to be robust to variations in the volume and the QoS requirement of the<br>
network traffic after being evaluated in different traffic scenarios.</p>
