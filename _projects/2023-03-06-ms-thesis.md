description: |
  My thesis project of the KTH Master's program in Machine Learning is about cellular traffic clustering and multi-agent reinforcement learning for energy-efficient base station control. The project is supervised by [Dr. Ã–zlem Tugfe Demir](https://www.kth.se/profile/ozlemtd) and examined by [Prof. Cicek Cavdar](https://www.kth.se/profile/cavdar). The thesis abstract can be found in [English](../../resources/thesis-abstract-en.html) and in [Swedish](../../resources/thesis-abstract-se.html), and the full thesis report can be downloaded [here](../../resources/Cai_Thesis.pdf).
