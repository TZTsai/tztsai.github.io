My [thesis project](https://github.com/TZTsai/master-thesis-project) of the KTH Master's program in Machine Learning is about cellular traffic clustering and multi-agent reinforcement learning for energy-efficient base station control. The project is supervised by [Dr. Ã–zlem Tugfe Demir](https://www.kth.se/profile/ozlemtd) and examined by [Prof. Cicek Cavdar](https://www.kth.se/profile/cavdar). The thesis abstract can be found in [English](../../resources/thesis-abstract-en.html) and in [Swedish](../../resources/thesis-abstract-se.html), and the full thesis report can be downloaded [here](../../resources/Cai_Thesis.pdf).

The first part of the thesis project is site classification and modelling of different traffic scenarios like rural, urban, office, etc.
The second part is cooperative base station control using a multi-agent deep RL algorithm (MAPPO) in multi-cell 5G networks to optimize energy efficiency while preserving quality of service .
